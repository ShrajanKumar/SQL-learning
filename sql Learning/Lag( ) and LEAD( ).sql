#Exercise 1

#Write a query that can extract the following information from the "employees" database:
#the salary values (in ascending order) of the contracts signed by all employees numbered between 10500 and 10600 inclusive
#a column showing the previous salary from the given ordered list
#a column showing the subsequent salary from the given ordered list
#a column displaying the difference between the current salary of a certain employee and their previous salary
#a column displaying the difference between the next salary of a certain employee and their current salary
#Limit the output to salary values higher than $80,000 only.
#Also, to obtain a meaningful result, partition the data by employee number.

#Exercise 2
#create a query whose result set contains data arranged by the salary values associated to each employee number (in ascending order). Let the output contain the following six columns:
#the employee number
#the salary value of an employee's contract (i.e. which weâ€™ll consider as the employee's current salary)
#the employee's previous salary
#the employee's contract salary value preceding their previous salary
#the employee's next salary
#the employee's contract salary value subsequent to their next salary
#Restrict the output to the first 1000 records you can obtain.
